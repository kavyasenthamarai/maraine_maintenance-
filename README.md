# ⚙️ Predictive Fault Detection and Maintenance System

This predictive fault detection and maintenance system utilizes WebSocket streaming, machine learning, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard. Originally designed for marine gas turbine plants, this system can be adapted to various industries, such as wind turbines, factory machines, and other industrial systems. It aims to reduce human intervention, minimize downtime, and lower maintenance costs by providing real-time alerts and fault predictions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 🔌 WebSocket Data Streaming
- Real-time data is streamed from marine gas turbine plant sensors via a WebSocket server.
- Data includes live readings and predicted decay values from the ML model.
- Updates every **2 seconds**.

### 🧠 Machine Learning (Random Forest)
- A **RandomForestRegressor** model predicts:
  - Compressor decay (`gt_c_decay`)
  - Turbine decay (`gt_t_decay`)
- Model is trained on historical sensor data and uses **StandardScaler** for feature normalization.

### 📊 Streamlit Dashboard
- Live graphs for temperature, pressure, decay rates.
- Instant alerts for threshold violations.
- Maintenance history management and actionable suggestions.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 📁 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marine_maintenance.git
cd marine_maintenance
```

### 🐍 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts ctivate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Example `requirements.txt`:
```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
websockets
matplotlib
plotly
```

---

### 🔁 3. Run the WebSocket Server

```bash
python backend/websocket_server.py
```

This simulates real-time sensor streaming and prediction. It should output:
```
WebSocket server started on ws://localhost:8000
```

---

### 📊 4. Launch the Streamlit Dashboard

In a new terminal, run:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

> The dashboard will open in your browser at:  
> `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

### 📈 Estimation Formulas

#### Compressor Decay (y1 = gt_c_decay)
```
y1 = (1/N) * Σ Ti^(c)(X)
```

#### Turbine Decay (y2 = gt_t_decay)
```
y2 = (1/N) * Σ Ti^(t)(X)
```

- `Ti^(c)(X)` and `Ti^(t)(X)` are outputs from each decision tree.
- `X` are standardized sensor inputs.
- `N` is the number of trees in the Random Forest.

### 🔃 Standardization Formula

```
X_scaled = (X - μ) / σ
```

- Ensures all features have zero mean and unit variance.

### 🔍 Fault Detection Rule

```
IF y1 > threshold_c OR y2 > threshold_t:
    Trigger Fault Alert
```
